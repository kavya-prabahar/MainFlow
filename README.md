# MainFlow
This repository is created for my virtual internship in Data Science with Python at Main Flow Services and Technologies.

**Task_1.ipynb:** This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. 
The colab file consists of a Python program to create a list, adictionary, and a set and performing basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.
